Kick off your project with this blog boilerplate. This starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need to get up and running blazing fast with the blazing fast app generator for React.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Clone or fork the repository.**

    ```shell
    # Clone The Repository
    https://github.com/Joey-Robinson/Open-Source-Cookbook.git
    ```

1.  **Install Dependencies.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and install dependencies.

    ```shell
    cd Open-Source-Cookbook/
    npm install
    # If needed, run the following:
    npm install -g gatsby-cli
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    Head over to the `content/blog/recipes/` directory to get started.

## ðŸ¥˜ Making a recipe.

1.  **New Recipe.**

    To make a new recipe, you'll need to create a new folder AND file inside of the `content/blog/recipes/` directory. You'll name the folder the recipe you want.

    ```shell
    # New Folder:
    my-awesome-recipe
    # New File:
    index.md
    ```

1.  **Content.**

    First, you'll need to add the frontmatter, like so:

    ```shell
    # Recipe Frontmatter
    ---
    title: "Pizza"
    date: "2020-03-06"
    category: "recipes"
    author: "Joey Robinson"
    description: "My Sweet New Recipe"
    cover: "./pizza.jpg"
    ---
    ```

    Each frontmatter field will have the information you want with the name you want. You _MUST_ have a cover image inside of the folder you created or things will blow up!

    Once you've done that, it's your time to shine! Start adding your recipe with ingredients & directions. If you want to add images, you simply need to type the following anywhere you want to place the image:

    ```shell
    # Adding an image
    ![Pizza](pizza.jpg)
    ```

That's it! Just make sure the image is in the folder and you're all set! Next I'll go over how to add your recipe to the site.

## ðŸŽ‰ Adding your recipe to the site.

1.  Committing your changes.

After you've added your recipe, it's time to commit your changes and submit a pull request. \_Make sure **NOTHING** else is changed in the project before committing.

Once you've typed out your recipe, you'll want to commit the change(s) you've and push it back up to GitHub.

After that submit a pull request and wait for a review and a merge.

## ðŸš« What's not allowed.

1.  What's not allowed.

The following items(s) are not allowed: _ANY_ changes outside of the designated directory. _ANY_ changes outside of that will not be merged unless opened as a different pull request.

That's all. Enjoy.
